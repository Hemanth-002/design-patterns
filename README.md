Design principles

# Chapter - 1
1. Encapsulation : 
   take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary     without affecting those that donâ€™t.

2. Program to an interface, not an implementation:
   
3. Composition : 
   Favor composition over inheritance.(HAS-A behaviour)

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.
   Ex: Duck example 
   Ex: Character example

   extends -- Inheritance of class  ________|>

   implements -- Implementation of interface -------|> 

   HAS-A -- interface inside class  _________>

# 2 Chapter - 2

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.

1. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.\

# Chapter - 3

The Open-Closed Principle:
   Classes should be open for extension, but closed for
   modification.

The Decorator Pattern:
   The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
   Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
   subclassing for extending functionality.

   extends -- Inheritance of class  ________|>

   implements -- Implementation of interface -------|> 

   HAS-A -- interface inside class  _________>
